# Hackathon 1

## Problem

A class of students have an inumerable amount of video resources shared amongst them (and from their lovely instructors). These links are shared via: slack, discord, notes application, etc.

[Context switching](https://asana.com/resources/context-switching) (frequently shifting focus between different tasks, projects, or applications) "hurts productivity and increases overwhelm, making us simultaneously more stressed and less productive".

## Solution

In an ideal world, students will collaborate on a YouTube playlist where all relevant videos are in one place. But how do you quickly search for the video you want without leaving what you're currently working on???

### LinkList

LinkList is a chrome extension that utilizes the YouTube API to search a playlist for specific videos by keyword and return a list of links to take you straight to them!

## MVP Goal

Build a chrome extension that searches an existing youtube playlist and returns a list of video links as results.

## Challenges

## Stretch Goals

1. Search settings
   - return links or thumbnails
   - max results
   - order videos
2. Favorites?
3. Integrate AI to suggest videos on topic
